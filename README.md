# CS2010-2015-2016-S1
Solutions to problem sets (PSes) for CS2010 Data Structures and Algorithms 2 at NUS. They involved implementing the following algorithms/data structures:

* PS1: priority queue
* PS2: AVL binary search tree for subtasks A-D, suffix array for subtask E
* PS3: minimum spanning tree
* PS4: finding articulation points in a graph
* PS5: shortest path problem using at most k vertices for subtasks A-C, solving the maximum flow problem with the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm in subtask D
* PS6: travelling salesman problem using dynamic programming (small instances) and the 2-opt heuristic for larger instances
